4. Perform axfr queries on nameservers and get BIND VERSION (threaded).

5. Get extra names and subdomains via google scraping
   (google query = "-www site:domain").

6. Brute force subdomains from file, can also perform recursion
   on subdomain that have NS records (all threaded).

   queries on them (threaded).
